# Reminder of techniques used in these exercises:

## anagram
Allowing for arguments as an array or multiple strings

Reminder that I can fool around with the objects I've got...ie. in order to sort the letters in a string, I split them and put them in an array. JS doesn't evaluate == on arrays. BUT I can join the elements of the arrays back into strings and then directly compare them. 

## beer-song
*concat* for strings - didn't work, need to ask someone why

## etl
using *for(prop in object)* to iterate through an object

## food-chain
recursion! haven't done much with that recently...

## isogram
regex to split a string on whitespace or '-'

## pangram 
*some* for arrays - returns true as soon as its callback finds a truthy value

## phone-number
*filter* for arrays - DIY filtering!
*replace* with regex for strings - always good to practice regex

## robot-name
*Math.random()* with parameters
*String.fromCharCode(charCode)* to get the string associated with, say 65 (it's 'A')

## word-count 
*Object.hasOwnProperty(prop)*
