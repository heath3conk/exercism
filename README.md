# Interesting stuff in JS I hadn't used much before:

## anagram
 - Allowing for arguments as an array or multiple strings
 - Reminder that I can fool around with the objects I've got...ie. in order to sort the letters in a string, I split them and put them in an array. JS doesn't evaluate == on arrays. BUT I can join the elements of the arrays back into strings and then correctly compare them. 

## beer-song
*concat* for strings - didn't work, need to ask someone why

## food-chain
recursion! haven't done much with that recently...

## pangram 
*some* for arrays - returns true as soon as its callback finds a truthy value

## phone-number
*filter* for arrays - DIY filtering!
*replace* with regex for strings - always good to practice regex
