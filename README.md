# Interesting JS functions I hadn't used much before:

## beer-song
*concat* for strings - didn't work, need to ask someone why

## pangram 
*some* for arrays - returns true as soon as its callback finds a truthy value

## phone-number
*filter* for arrays - DIY filtering!
*replace* with regex for strings - always good to practice regex
