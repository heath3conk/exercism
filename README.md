# Interesting stuff in JS I hadn't used much before:

## anagram
Allowing for arguments as an array or multiple strings
(Ruby makes this challenge so easy! No == for arrays in JS)

## beer-song
*concat* for strings - didn't work, need to ask someone why

## pangram 
*some* for arrays - returns true as soon as its callback finds a truthy value

## phone-number
*filter* for arrays - DIY filtering!
*replace* with regex for strings - always good to practice regex
